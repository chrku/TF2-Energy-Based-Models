# TF2-Energy-Based-Models

This main repository deals with implementing the techniques
presented in the papers of Du and Mordatch (2019) and
Grathwohl et al. (2020). I implemented the main
techniques in these papers (using Tensorflow 2.0) and applied them to
various datasets.

How to use the code to train Energy-Based Models and the Joint-Energy Model can be seen in
the Jupyter notebooks included with the code.
